# University Projects
This repo might look rather empty, but this is a conscious choice. Typically, the projects I have completed are recycled by the University and used again in later years in some form. For this reason, I am hesitant to put up my "solutions" to the projects and the writeups/code in a public GitHub Repository. I have included links in my CV (just click on the relevant project in the pdf and it will redirect you to a Google Drive link) if you want to see the project write ups and code. I will include here all the project specifications for the projects that I attempted in this repo so you can browse through the rough idea of each project.
I would generally reccommend looking at the more recent stuff - my LaTeXing and coding ability improved dramatically during my undergrad!
